# FireLynx Configuration Example: Logger Presets and Output Destinations
#
# This configuration demonstrates the new preset-based logging system and
# configurable output destinations.
#
# Features demonstrated:
# - Using preset configurations for common logging scenarios
# - File output destinations
# - Path filtering with exclude patterns
# - Simplified configuration using presets
#
# Environment Variable Support:
# The output field supports environment variable interpolation using ${VAR_NAME} syntax.
# Example: output = "/var/log/app-${HOSTNAME}.log"
# If HOSTNAME is not set, configuration loading will fail with a clear error message.
