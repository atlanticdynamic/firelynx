# Config Transaction Package

The `transaction` package implements the Config Saga pattern, providing clear ownership and tracking of configuration throughout its entire lifecycle.

## Architectural Context

- **Configuration as a Saga**: Treating configuration changes as a distributed "meta" transaction with compensation
- **Comprehensive Observability**: Capturing metadata for every stage of the process

## Integration with System Architecture

### Component Lifecycle Integration

The transaction system works alongside the `supervisor` package's lifecycle management. Components that receive configuration implement the `SagaParticipant` interface from `txmgr`, which integrates with:

- **Supervisor Runnables**: Leveraging the standard lifecycle (Run, Stop) for components
- **Stateable Components**: Tracking readiness and operational state during transitions
- **Coordinated Execution**: Ensuring configuration changes propagate in dependency order

### Error Recovery Model

When configuration changes fail in any component, the orchestrator can:

1. Identify exactly which component failed
2. Roll back successful components in reverse order before final commit
3. Restore the system to its previous consistent state
4. Preserve detailed diagnostic information for troubleshooting

This eliminates partial updates which could leave the system in an inconsistent state.

## Practical Usage

The `SagaOrchestrator` in the `txmgr` package uses this framework to coordinate configuration changes across all system components, ensuring consistent transitions between configuration states.
