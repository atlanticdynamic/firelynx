# Config Transaction Package

The `transaction` package implements the Config Saga pattern, providing clear ownership and tracking of configuration throughout its entire lifecycle.

## Purpose

This package addresses several architectural challenges:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Tracks configuration from reception to activation
2. **Metadata Preservation**: Retains source info, validation state, and processing history
3. **Component Isolation**: Provides adapters so components only access what they need
4. **Validation Enforcement**: Ensures configuration is validated before runtime use

## Design Goals

- **Single Source of Truth**: One central object manages configuration state
- **Reduced Coupling**: Components depend on adapters instead of direct config types
- **Immutability**: Component-specific views are immutable for thread safety
- **Clear Validation**: Runtime components can easily verify validation state
- **Rich Diagnostics**: Preserves history for improved troubleshooting

## Core Components

- **ConfigTransaction**: Central object representing configuration's lifecycle
- **Adapters**: Component-specific views limiting dependencies
- **Validation Gate**: Mechanism that prevents using unvalidated configuration
